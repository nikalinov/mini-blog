## Overview/main page
* The first page a user sees contains a list with all blogs. There is information about each blog: author, date, views, rating (number of likes), and content type(s). 
* The user can sort the list based on the available options and move through the pages of blogs. 
* The blog's title and author's username are clickable and will lead to the blog page and author profile, correspondingly.

## Login and registration
* To register, one should fill all the necessary fields. The password's length must be at least 8 characters and include 1 lowercase, 1 uppercase, 1 number, and 1 symbol.
* After that, the account must be activated by following the link which is sent to the email from the registration form.
* Using the activated account credentials, a new user can log in with their email and password.
* If a user forgets the password, they can reset it using the 'Forgot your password?' link on the login page.
## Blog page
* A user can find links to blogs either on the main page or a user's page (see [User/author profile](#userauthor-profile) part).
* There is custom background, title, and blog data (author, likes, and views) at the header section.
* Blog body can contain both text and media (images, videos, etc.) content.
* At the bottom, there is comment section, where logged-in users can leave their comments about the blog.
 
## User/author profile
* A profile consists of some user data (username, full name, social networks, etc.) and blogs if the user has written them.
* The blogs can be sorted in the same way as on [the main page](#overviewmain-page).
* If a user is viewing their own profile, they can edit it: change any visible fields or the profile picture.
