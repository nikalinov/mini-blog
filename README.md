## Overview/main page
(See the GIF below) The first page a user sees contains a list with all blogs. There is information shown for each blog (content types, author, etc.). The user can sort the list based on the available options and move through the pages of blogs. The blog's title and author's name are clickable and will lead to the blog page and author profile, correspondingly.
